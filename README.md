# RPG.2D-top-down-movement

This was a fun project originally intended to learn how to make a full game from scratch. 
It ended up being good material to learn how mapping and movements work in 2D games (in this case with "top-down" view).

this project was made with python, using the library **pygame** for the base of the UI.
